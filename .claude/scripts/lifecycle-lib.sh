# -lifecycle.json, domain writes -manifest.json (issue #1006). Callers should
# use this helper instead of hardcoding the path. The previous migration-compat
# fallback (read legacy .runs/<skill>-manifest.json when framework-exclusive
# keys present) was removed per issue #1027 now that the rename release cycle
# has elapsed. Any user who has not re-run any skill since the rename will see
# NO_MANIFEST errors and must delete .runs/ — acceptable because .runs/ is
# git-ignored and skill state is ephemeral.
