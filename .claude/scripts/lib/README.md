# `.claude/scripts/lib/` — Reusable helpers

Python helpers + bash utilities reusable across template scripts. Keep this directory **small and load-bearing** — only add a helper here when 2+ callers will use it (per CLAUDE.md Rule 4: 3+ similar lines is better than premature abstraction; new lib entries should beat that bar with concrete reuse, not hypothetical).

## Discovery convention

When a helper is intentionally **template-level reusable** (i.e. designed to be the canonical mechanism for solving a class of problem in any future fix), document it with a `## Stack Knowledge` section below. The convention mirrors `.claude/stacks/**/*.md` `## Stack Knowledge` sections so that:

- `/solve` Phase 1 Agent 2 (Prior Art) can grep `composite_identity` and surface the entry as `fix_template` candidate
- `/resolve` diagnosis can locate prior solutions for similar issues
- Future PRs that re-invent an existing solution get caught at review

This is the runtime-discoverable side of the auto-discovery mechanism (#1285) — solving the "reusables built by one /solve are invisible to the next" problem incrementally for the helpers that are most likely to be reused.

Helpers NOT intended for reuse (one-off utilities, single-caller adapters) should NOT have a `## Stack Knowledge` section. The conservative bar: add when first concrete second caller demonstrates reuse value, not on first introduction.

  iterate_cross_email_filter.py is the canonical deterministic filter for
  email-bearing signup rows from both Supabase and Railway. It classifies
  rows into real/team/test using operator-owned config, reserved test
  domains, team domains, Gmail normalization, and plus-alias handling.
  It returns only aggregate counts and redacted audit entries so .runs
  artifacts, Telegram output, and HTML reports never persist full emails.
fix_template: |
  When a DB ground-truth integration reads signup rows, select email-bearing
  rows instead of count(*), call filter_signups(rows, config), and persist:
  db_signups_raw, db_signups_real, db_signups_team, db_signups_test,
  db_signups_filter_audit, db_signups_real_windowed, and db_first_signup_at.
  Never write raw email addresses to .runs artifacts; use redact_email().

  the operator-visible team org, parse the project ref from the MVP's
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, call _read_token(), then call
  list_supabase_projects(token). Pass only when the project ref appears in the

  Declarative rules in .claude/patterns/gate-evidence-rules.json describe
  per-rule evidence sources, matchers, and failure citations. A generic
  runner (lib.gate_evidence_runner) loads rules through
  jsonschema.validate() against gate-evidence-rule-schema.json, resolves
  evidence sources via glob+reader (json | jsonl | grep_tsx | filesystem),
  applies matchers (template_literal_navigation | friction_event_extraction
  | recovery_skip_extraction | any_of_patterns), and emits structured
  failures with citations. Each rule honors a MODE env var (warn|deny) +
  schema_version_gate.required_schema_version() for soak-then-flip rollout
  and pre-cutoff grandfathering.

  Two seed rules ship with the foundation:
    - bg2-wire-nav-reachability (#1473): for dynamic-only pages
      (derive_dynamic_only_pages classification == "dynamic-only"),
      REPLACE bare-slug href requirement with template-literal navigation
      requirement (`<Link href={`/<page>/${...}`}>` somewhere under
      src/app/**/*.tsx or src/components/nav-bar.tsx). For "static" pages,
      preserve current bare-slug semantics. For "mixed" pages, require BOTH.
    - agent-workaround-pairing (#1470): cross-references friction events
      from .runs/agent-traces/*.json (workarounds[] +
      template_gap_observed[]) and .runs/verify-recheck.json
      (verify_results[].passed=false) against
      .runs/retrospective-filed-findings.json filed[] OR
      .runs/retrospective-result.json suppressions[] (with rationale).
      Unpaired events fail the gate with specific citation.

  Meta-coverage lint rule rule_gate_verdict_evidence_coverage
  (template-coherence-rules.json) enforces that every structural-shape
  gate-keeper check (test -f / test -d / grep -E.*href / grep -c) is
  either covered by a rule in gate-evidence-rules.json OR carries an
  explicit evidence_check_intentionally_structural annotation. Prevents
  meta-level structural-proxy regression where new gate-keeper checks
  silently revert to gameable shape-only enforcement.

  Solve-critic Vector 8 (field-citation-verification) catches the
  recurring "design cites field name without grep-verifying it exists in
  the cited source file" failure mode that produced 4/9 round-2 TYPE A
  concerns during the originating /solve --defect run.

fix_template: |
  When a gate's pass-signal is currently a structural shape check (file
  existence, key presence, literal substring match) but the gate's INTENT
  is a semantic property (route reachability, observation fidelity,
  recovery-path validity), add a new rule to
  .claude/patterns/gate-evidence-rules.json:

    {
      "id": "<gate-id>-<purpose>",
      "type": "navigation_reachability | friction_event_extraction | recovery_path_observation",
      "gate_id": "<gate-id>",
      "severity": "warn",  # flip to block after soak (1-2 real skill cycles)
      "evidence_sources": [
        {"path_glob": "<glob>", "reader": "json|jsonl|grep_tsx|filesystem",
         "always_included_paths": ["..."]}
      ],
      "matcher": {"kind": "<matcher>", "params": {...}},
      "expected_observation": {
        "artifact_path": "<runtime-artifact>",
        "predicate": "exists_with_citation | array_non_empty | matches_friction_count",
        "params": {...}
      },
      "failure_citation_format": "<jinja-style template>",
      "mode_env": "GATE_EVIDENCE_<NAME>_MODE",
      "schema_cutoff": true
    }

  The gate-keeper.md (or check-observation-artifacts.sh) numbered check
  then delegates to:
    python3 .claude/scripts/verify-gate-evidence.py --rule-id <rule-id>
  Exit 0=PASS, 1=BLOCK, 2=infrastructure-error.

  Soak strategy (#1291 convention):
    1. severity="warn" + MODE=warn for 1-2 real skill cycles
    2. Inspect .runs/ for false positives via `verify-linter.sh` output
    3. Flip severity="block" and document in follow-up PR
    4. Default MODE remains "warn"; deny-mode opt-in via env var

  Round-2 critic guards baked into the runner:
    - jsonschema.validate() at load (Plan-Agent-A Open Risk 1: malformed
      registry produces SystemExit(2) with schema path, not stack trace)
    - Slug-suffix awareness in matchers (round-2 Concern 487fdf73cf62):
      hyphenated experiment.yaml slugs (`portfolio-detail`) resolve to
      static-prefix folders (`portfolio/[slug]`); the matcher searches
      for both forms
    - rg-style multi-line matching for template literals (BG2 check 18
      pattern; round-2 Concern Plan-Agent-B-8)
    - Optional catch-all (`[[...slug]]`) classified as static (round-2
      Concern Plan-Agent-B-2 inversion: optional matches `/` so bare slug
      IS reachable)

  Usage from a Python validator or gate-keeper invocation:
    from lib.gate_evidence_runner import load_rules, run_rule, format_failure
    rules = load_rules()
    for rule in rules:
        mode, failures = run_rule(rule)
        # ... format and emit

  Sibling pattern to EARC (Evidence-Anchored Repair Channel, #1189). Any
  agent-traces/*.json writer path that produces a schema-valid artifact
  under exceptional / recovery / post-completion conditions MUST either:
    (a) write the full schema with real data, OR
    (b) appear as a candidate row in retrospective-pending-findings.json
        (paired observation) that the lead files or suppresses.

  Detection runs at observation-phase Step 5a via two GECR rules
  (.claude/patterns/gate-evidence-rules.json):

    - recovery-path-skip-pairing (#1468): traces with provenance in
      {self-degraded, recovery, lead-orchestrated} AND partial=true AND
      a non-sanctioned degraded_reason AND a detectable skipped depth-
      check (landing: candidates_tried==0 with unused sidecar candidates;
      non-landing has_images=true: image_issues_for_landing key absent).

    - sparse-trace-pairing (#1456): traces with status="started" + no
      verdict (init-stub survived), OR provenance="lead-orchestrated"
      missing AOC v1.3 required fields (workarounds[] /
      template_gap_observed[]).

  Both rules use the recovery_skip_extraction matcher in
  gate_evidence_runner.py and emit candidates via two new enumerator
  kinds (recovery-path-skip, sparse-trace) in
  enumerate-pending-retrospective-findings.py. The matches_friction_count
  predicate requires the candidate to be either filed via
  file-retrospective-finding.py OR suppressed in retrospective-result.json
  suppressions[] with a closed-enum reason.

  Sanctioned legitimate-skip degraded_reasons (empty-boundary-fast-path
  from #1061, demo-mode-fixture-short-circuit from #1042,
  redirect-source-only from #1196) are anchored to the canonical list in
  .claude/scripts/lib/sanctioned_degraded_reasons.py — adding a new
  sanctioned skip requires editing exactly one file (no drift between
  merge-design-critic-traces.py carve-out and the matcher suppression).

  Phase C cutover criteria for both rules: see
  .claude/patterns/gecr-cutover-criteria.json + verify-linter rule
  gecr-cutover-overdue (closes the #1437/#1415 meta-pattern where soak-
  mode advisory-only carve-outs were forgotten and permanently weakened
  enforcement).

fix_template: |
  When a new fallback writer path is introduced (or an existing one
  surfaces a regression), register the OARC mechanism BEFORE shipping:

    1. If the fallback shape isn't captured by recovery-path-skip or
       sparse-trace, extend the recovery_skip_extraction matcher in
       gate_evidence_runner.py with a new sub-kind (mirror existing
       handlers ~lines 440+).

    2. Add a corresponding enumerator function to
       enumerate-pending-retrospective-findings.py mirroring
       _candidates_from_sparse_traces. Register the kind in
       KIND_PRIORITY (assign next sequential rank) and append to main().

    3. Register a new GECR rule in .claude/patterns/gate-evidence-rules.json
       with type="recovery_path_observation", matcher.kind=
       "recovery_skip_extraction", and matches_friction_count predicate
       targeting the new kind via params.target_kinds.

    4. Add the rule's mode_env entry to
       .claude/patterns/gecr-cutover-criteria.json with soak_window +
       deny_flip_trigger so the meta-defense linter tracks the cutover.

    5. Cover with unit tests in test_oarc_matcher.py.

  Sanctioned-skip carve-outs:
    - Append to .claude/scripts/lib/sanctioned_degraded_reasons.py
    - Document source PR/issue in .claude/agents/design-critic.md
      Rendered-Review Contract or equivalent sanctioned-skip section

  - .claude/agents/landing-images-critic.md (Step 5.5 self-degrade)
  - .claude/agents/solve-critic.md (round-2 post-completion)
  - .claude/scripts/merge-landing-critic-traces.py (sparse sub-trace handling)

  Pixel-only perceptual hash is bypassable by trivial transforms (rotate,

  CI auto-discovers .claude/scripts/tests/test_*.py via .github/workflows/ci.yml
  (do NOT place under top-level tests/ — that is NOT in CI discovery).

  ---

  Cross-state coverage sub-pattern (added per #1294).

  When a validator must run at MULTIPLE state-registry entries (e.g., one
  per spawn-site downstream), declare an explicit allowlist in VALIDATORS:

    "validate-X.py": {
      "ref_files": [".claude/patterns/state-registry.json"],
      "state_registry_states": [("bootstrap", "11b"), ("bootstrap", "11c"), ...],
    }

  Then add four cooperating meta-tests:
    D-2 explicit: each (skill, state_id) in state_registry_states must have
        the validator chained in its verify command.
    D-3 auto-discovery: walk `.claude/skills/**/state-*.md` for the canonical
        spawn marker `^\s*-\s*subagent_type:\s*<agent-prefix>-[a-z-]+\s*$`
        (line-anchored, MULTILINE). For each match, assert a downstream
        allowlisted state exists. Walks ALL skills — future scaffold-*
        spawns in /change /upgrade /resolve auto-fail until wired.
    D-4 superset: allowlist must cover every present spawn site (catches
        accidental allowlist deletions).
    D-5 inverse drift: every state-registry mention of the validator must
        appear in the allowlist (catches: maintainer wires a new state
        without updating VALIDATORS dict).

  Aggregate-trace propagation (sibling pattern).

  When a state-machine merges per-agent traces into an aggregate (e.g.,
  merge-scaffold-pages-traces.py merging scaffold-pages-<slug>.json into
  scaffold-pages.json), the merger MUST propagate validator-required
  schema fields into the aggregate. Validators glob over .runs/agent-traces
  and apply uniformly to per-agent and aggregate files; without
  propagation the aggregate fails the schema check. Mirror the merger's
  stub-skip partition in the validator (`if status=='started' and not
  verdict: return []`) so rate-limited stubs (#1190) don't trigger
  spurious failures.

  invoke .claude/scripts/lib/write-gate-artifact.sh with --path and --payload.

  auto-stamps them.

  Reference (in-skill, normal flow):
    PAYLOAD=$(python3 -c "

    print(json.dumps({'key': 'value'}))
    ")
    bash .claude/scripts/lib/write-gate-artifact.sh \

fix_template: |
  When an agent or script needs to enumerate pages (for design-critic
  spawning, page-image manifest generation, scope verification, etc.), do
  NOT recompute from the raw user-journey field in experiment.yaml. Use the
  helpers:

    from lib.derive_pages import derive_scope_pages, derive_validation_pages
    pages = derive_scope_pages(experiment_yaml_dict)  # SET — must exist on disk
    journey = derive_validation_pages(experiment_yaml_dict)  # LIST — user flow

  The helpers handle auth-derived pages, behavior-derived pages, and
  archetype-specific rules uniformly. Raw access to that field is caught by
  field_role_map at lint time.

  gclid_filter.PAID_GCLID_FILTER is the single HogQL fragment that any
  /iterate --cross query MUST use to filter for real Google Ads paid traffic.
  It combines (a) coalesce($session_entry_gclid, properties.gclid) for
  attribution-path robustness when PostHog SDK init loses the race against
  Next.js router URL cleanup, and (b) length>40 + prefix in {Cj, EAI, CIa}
  to exclude operator manual-test gclids (e.g. analytics-verify-* 32-char
  strings that slipped past the prior length>30 rule).
fix_template: |
  When a HogQL query needs to filter for real Google Ads paid traffic, do
  NOT hand-write `properties.$session_entry_gclid IS NOT NULL AND length...`
  inline. Import the shared filter:

    # Python f-string contexts (state-x1, state-x2, etc.):
    import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.claude/scripts/lib')
    from gclid_filter import PAID_GCLID_FILTER
    sql = f"... WHERE {PAID_GCLID_FILTER} ..."

    # Bash contexts (state-x0, state-c2):

    cat > /tmp/q.json <<JSON
    {"query":{"kind":"HogQLQuery","query":"... WHERE $PAID_GCLID_FILTER ..."}}
    JSON

  The Python-side validator `is_real_gclid(s)` mirrors the SQL rule for
  unit-testable checks. All 5 historical query sites (state-x0 canonical,
  state-x0 orphan, state-x1, state-x2, state-c2) already read from this
  helper. Any new query MUST follow the same pattern.

  iterate_cross_posthog_batch.py is the canonical execution helper for
  /iterate --cross PostHog queries that can grow with portfolio size. Discovery
  queries must use paginate_discovery_query() so LIMIT/OFFSET pages continue
  until a short page proves completeness. Per-MVP UNION ALL query groups must
  use run_union_batches() so HogQL execution stays under timeout limits while
  preserving one concatenated results payload for downstream state code.
fix_template: |
  In state bash, build the SQL parts in Python, import the helper from
  .claude/scripts/lib, and call:

    rows, metadata = paginate_discovery_query(sql, values, project_id, api_key, page_size=200)
    rows, metadata = run_union_batches(parts, values, project_id, api_key, batch_size=20)

  Write raw artifacts as {"results": rows, "<state_status_key>": metadata}
  and propagate the metadata into the gate-readable context/data artifact
  through the standard state artifact writer.

fix_template: |
  When implementing logic that reads per-page design-critic traces, do NOT
  glob `.runs/agent-traces/design-critic-*.json` directly:

    traces = select_latest_per_page_traces(traces_dir)
    # traces: dict[page_key -> trace_path] where epoch-suffixed wins

  Direct glob misses the recovery-respawn epoch convention: a post-fix
  re-spawn writes design-critic-<page>.<epoch>.json which shadows the
  original. Both aggregator and gate must agree on which epoch wins.

  protected substrings (writer names, manifest paths, etc.).
fix_template: |
  When a hook needs to scan a Bash command string for protected tokens
  (e.g., write-gate-artifact.sh enforcement), do NOT grep raw $COMMAND:

    from lib.canonicalize_bash_command import canonicalize
    canonical = canonicalize(raw_bash_command)
    # canonical: heredoc bodies stripped, comments preserved
    if PROTECTED_TOKEN in canonical:
        deny(...)

  Raw substring match has a documented false-positive class (#1298): a
  heredoc body containing the writer name (e.g., the README itself) trips
  the guard. The canonicalizer fixes three separate correctness bugs vs.
  the inline strip_heredoc_bodies that previously lived in
  check-advance-state-invocation.py.

    intent = extract_render_from_text(jsx_source)
    usages = find_image_usages(jsx_source)

  The heuristics cover className-based size/aspect inference, Image

  recurrence_guard_parser.parse is the single source of truth for the typed

  artifact-existence gate (verify-rmg-guard-artifact-in-diff.py) consumes
  the canonical dict shape; free-text strings fail at parse time post-cutover.
fix_template: |
  When writing or consuming a recurrence_guard, ALWAYS go through the parser:

    from lib.recurrence_guard_parser import parse, RecurrenceGuardParseError
    try:
        canonical = parse(guard_value)  # accepts dict OR light-mode bullet
    except RecurrenceGuardParseError as exc:
        sys.exit(f"recurrence_guard does not parse: {exc}")
    # canonical: {"kind", "artifact", "rationale", "unguardability_rationale"?}

  Do NOT hand-roll YAML parsing or accept free-text — the parser enforces
  rationale length (<=200 chars), kind enum, artifact-required-when-not-none,
  and unguardability_rationale-required-when-none. Tolerant mode
  (RMG_V2_TOLERANT=1) is the emergency escape hatch only.

  runs_reader.py exposes four functions that force every .runs/ read to
  declare provenance intent:
    - discover_current_run_id(branch?, project_dir?, include_completed=False, head_commit_timestamp?)
        Identity-resolution. Two paths: active-only (include_completed=False;
        newest in-flight, preserves child-preference) vs PR-gate (3-pass:
        active top-level / completed top-level with HEAD-recency / orphan
        child). 48h staleness cap.
    - read_jsonl(path, *, scope, current_run_id?, cross_run_channel?)
        scope='current-run' filters rows by run_id with HC2-graceful skip of
        legacy rows missing run_id. scope='cross-run-by-design' requires the
        channel to be pre-registered in .claude/patterns/cross-run-channels.json.
        scope=None (omitted) → TypeError; scope is keyword-only.
    - read_context_files(branch?, *, include_completed=False, project_dir?)
        Returns list[dict] sorted by timestamp desc. Use discover_current_run_id
        if you need single-Identity precedence.
    - read_git_log(files, *, since_days=60, max_per_file=5, project_dir?)
        git-history-augmented scope; per-file granularity; caps prevent
        designer-burden cliff in dossier_builder.
  The companion linter rule `provenance_aware_runs_read` flags new .runs/
  reads in production code (tests excluded) that lack runs_reader.* call or
  `# coherence-allow: provenance-blind-read` pragma.
fix_template: |
  When reading per-run state (e.g., fix-ledger filtered to current skill):

                          cross_run_channel='fix-ledger')

  resistance; phase_4b adds them for cross-check). The _meta.divergence_files
  field carries the caller's input file set forward to dossier_verify's
  no-empty-bypass check (Issue #1415).
fix_template: |
  When a skill state needs Phase 1a Prior-Failure recall (resolve.5, solve.1,

  Always write the returned dict to .runs/prior-failure-dossier.json via
  the canonical writer (write-gate-artifact.sh --path
  .runs/prior-failure-dossier.json) so state-registry VERIFY can assert
  presence. Empty divergence_files produces an empty dossier; that is legal
  for fresh projects but is flagged by dossier_verify when the caller

  response count >= dossier phase_1a count.
fix_template: |
  When adding a state-registry.json VERIFY gate for a Phase 1a artifact (or
  any solve-reasoning sub-phase that produces a `.runs/X.json` file via lead

    from lib.dossier_verify import assert_dossier_loaded, DossierVerifyError

  Then append `&& python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.runs/X.json'))"`
  to the state-registry.json VERIFY string BEFORE the `#` comment so
  derive-graim-manifest.py auto-registers the path (AND-regex requires both
  `json.load(open(` and the literal in the same string). Always `make
  sync-verify` after editing state-registry.json. Empty-input bypass MUST be
  closed via a `_meta.divergence_files` cross-check.

  Equivalently from bash: pass --source-run-id and --source-skill to
  write-gate-artifact.sh; the validator is invoked for you. Don't bypass
  via direct json.dump — gate-artifact-write-gate.sh blocks Write/Edit
  on manifest paths anyway.

  Two coherence rules + two manifest categories:
    - hook_silent_skip_friction_pairing scans .claude/hooks/*.sh for any
      `exit 0` / `sys.exit(0)` and requires either a _write_hook_friction
      / deny / handle_validation call within 10 preceding lines OR a
      `# friction-skip: <reason>` pragma annotation.
    - hook_bypass_manifest_completeness validates that every entry in
      bypass-manifests (gate-readable-canonical-exemptions.json,
      adversarial-merge-trace-skip.json) declares category + justification.
  Hook code change: silent-skip paths now either friction-log (Constraint
  19 fail-open) OR fail-closed unless the manifest declares the skip
  (Mechanism A — adversarial-merge-gate change-challenge light-mode).
fix_template: |
  When a PreToolUse hook needs to early-exit, classify the exit:
    1. trivial-fast-path: hook's domain is structurally absent (no FILE_PATH,
       no COMMAND, no skill context). Annotate:
         # friction-skip: trivial-fast-path — <one-sentence why>
    2. post-validation: exit follows handle_validation, deny(), or an
       authoritative manifest decision. Annotate:
         # friction-skip: post-validation — <one-sentence why>
    3. silent-bypass: hook's enforcement *would* apply but is being skipped
       (mode=warn, manifest missing, unknown env-var value). Either:
         (a) _write_hook_friction "<msg>" before exit 0   # Constraint 19 fail-open
         (b) Replace with deny() gated by an exemption manifest  # Mechanism A
  Never leave bare `exit 0` — the linter rule
  hook_silent_skip_friction_pairing fails CI under --strict-aoc.

  verify_helpers.unstamped_values(d) / unstamped_items(d) filter out the
  31-field STAMPED_FIELDS union (skill, run_id, written_at, agent,
  timestamp, status, provenance, etc.) stamped by the four canonical
  trace writers. Use these from VERIFY blocks AND from any consumer
  that iterates a page/page or page/contract-keyed dict written via
  write-gate-artifact.sh. Raw d.values() leaks identity strings into
  assertions ("pass_self_pass_or_fail" string treated as a check value).
fix_template: |
  When consuming a canonical-writer .runs/*.json artifact whose top-level
  shape is {<key>: <payload>, ..., <stamped-identity-fields>}:

    # Wrong (will trip on stamped identity strings):
    for v in d.values():
        ...

    from verify_helpers import unstamped_items, unstamped_values
    for k, v in unstamped_items(d):

  STAMPED_FIELDS is the union across all four canonical writers
  (write-gate-artifact.sh, write-agent-trace.sh, write-recovery-trace.sh,
  write-skipped-fixer-trace.sh). The coherence rule
  verify-d-values-against-stamped-artifact catches state-registry VERIFY
  drift; this same defense applies to any Python consumer.

  `iterate_cross_classify.match_key(s)` is the single normalizer for comparing
  MVP identity strings across three independent surfaces:
    1. Canonical PostHog `project_name` (kebab-case: `x-predict`).
    2. Orphan-host URL subdomain (no hyphens: `xpredict.draftlabs.org` → `xpredict`).
    3. Google Ads campaign name (mixed case + suffixes: `xpredict #2`, `Lumen-Parth`).
  All three must compare equal when they refer to the same MVP. Strip
  non-alphanumeric chars and lowercase. Any consumer that hand-rolls a
  similar normalizer can drift (e.g., kebab-case stripping vs not, owner-suffix
  removal vs not), splitting one MVP into two records.
fix_template: |
  When matching an MVP identity string across surfaces:

    # Wrong — hand-rolled, likely to drift:

    if norm_a == norm_b: ...

    # Right — reuse the canonical normalizer:

  prose_gate_mode.resolve(gate_id, prior_default) centralizes effective-mode
  resolution across the 5 prose-gate enforcers/validators that have a
  warn↔deny gradient. Resolution chain (first match wins): tolerant escape
  > per-gate env > snapshot (version-checked) > registry (when v2+) >
  caller-passed prior_default. Snapshot taken at lifecycle-init time keeps
  in-flight runs safe against mid-run registry flips. prior_default
  preserves each gate's existing runtime behavior so registry edits do not
  silently regress (e.g., gate 5 caller passes "deny" preserving #1393
  phase-2 shipping decision).
fix_template: |
  When a registry/config field needs to become load-bearing AND callers
  currently each read their own env var with hardcoded defaults, AND
  in-flight processes must remain unaffected by mid-run config changes:

    1. Add a versioned snapshot field to per-run context at run-start
       (lifecycle-init.sh post-init Step 5c style). Stamp with
       `<config>_snapshot_at_version` so stale snapshots can be detected.
    2. Build a single resolution helper with explicit ordering:
         tolerant escape > per-key env > snapshot (version-gated) >
         registry (gated on schema version increment) > caller prior_default
    3. Each caller migrates to call the helper, passing its CURRENT runtime
       default as prior_default. This preserves existing behavior unless
       registry version increment + snapshot allows the registry to override.
    4. Bump registry _schema_version when the field becomes load-bearing —
       the version increment is the trigger that activates registry lookup.
    5. Add a soak summary tool (regime-aware: binary at low-sample,
       rate at medium, statistical at high) so per-flip rollback signal is
       observable per-key.

  Usage:
    # Bash caller:
    MODE=$(bash .claude/scripts/lib/prose_gate_mode.sh <gate_id> <prior_default>)

    # Python caller:
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))  # or .claude/scripts/lib

  append_deviation_log.append(payload) centralizes the deviation-log writer
  with: (a) POSIX O_APPEND atomicity for entries < PIPE_BUF (~4KB), (b)
  fsync before close (survives process crash), (c) on exception writes to
  a sibling write-failures.jsonl channel that is consumed by
  enumerate-pending-retrospective-findings.py 7th candidate source as
  HIGH-confidence findings (silent failures become observer-visible). Adds
  _meta.schema_version stamp for forward-compat.
fix_template: |
  When multiple callers append JSONL entries to a single observability log
  AND silent failures break downstream consumers (enumerator, observer):

    1. Centralize the appender into one helper. Caller-side: just call
       `append(entry_dict)`.
    2. Use POSIX `open(path, "a")` (O_APPEND atomic for writes < PIPE_BUF)
       + explicit f.flush() + os.fsync(f.fileno()) so writes survive crash.
    3. On exception: log to a sibling .write-failures.jsonl channel with
       {original_payload, exception, ts}. Best-effort writes to the failure
       channel itself; if even that fails, print to stderr.
    4. Wire the failure channel into the consumer's enumeration as HIGH-
       confidence findings — silent failures become surface-visible.
    5. Register both files in cross-run-channels.json (read-side metadata)
       per the cross_run_channel_exemption_pairing coherence rule.

  Usage:
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))  # or .claude/scripts/lib
    from append_deviation_log import append
    ok = append({"gate_id": "...", "evidence": {...}})
    # Returns True on success; False routes to write-failures.jsonl.
