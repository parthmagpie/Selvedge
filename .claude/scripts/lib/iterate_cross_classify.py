"""iterate_cross_classify.py — End-to-end signup classification pipeline for /iterate --cross x2.

Subcommands:
  prepare    Read data.json + issues.json + config → write classify-input.json
             (buckets: to_skip, to_auto with deterministic picks, to_llm with catalogs).
  persist    Read input.json + LLM proposals.json → filter hard-excluded events,
             merge with config (respecting `classified_by: operator` overrides),
             write config atomically.
  finalize   Read updated config + data.json + signup-counts.json (from PostHog query
             between persist and finalize) → fill data.json signup_events + signups,
             run sanity check, print summary, exit 1 if any suspect found.

Why a helper script (not inline state-file Python):

1. The full chain (filter → merge → write → query → update → sanity → summarize) is
   ~120 lines of code with multiple read/write contracts. Inline heredocs in the state
   file are read-only prose to the human reviewer; they're invisible to verify-linter
   and unrunnable without the agent's interpretation. A helper script makes the
   contract deterministic AND unit-testable.
2. Hard exclusion of UI events MUST be a code guard, not an LLM instruction. The
   `EXCLUDED_PATTERNS` list below is the source of truth — any event matching is
   stripped from any proposal regardless of source (LLM, whitelist, operator).
3. `classified_by: operator` lock MUST be enforced by the writer. Otherwise a
   silent overwrite breaks the user contract from PR #1375.

    """Merge aliased MVP rows into their canonical entry.

    Used by /iterate --cross state-x0 to dedup legacy duplicates — MVPs that
    were created before /bootstrap state-3 enforced kebab-case naming, so the
    same product exists in PostHog under two `project_name` values (e.g.
    `splitshare` and `split-share-neon`). The canonical form is named in
    `experiment/iterate-cross-config.yaml::mvp_aliases.<canonical>: [alias_a,
    alias_b, ...]`.

    Input rows follow the PostHog discovery query shape:
        [mvp_key, sample_utm_campaign, gclid_visitors, first_seen, last_seen]

    Merge semantics per canonical key:
    - gclid_visitors = sum of canonical row + all matched alias rows
    - first_seen = min, last_seen = max (across canonical + aliases)
    - sample_utm_campaign = pick from the row with the highest gclid_visitors
      (preserves the strongest signal for downstream filtering)

    Returns (merged_rows, audit). `audit` is a list of:
        {canonical, absorbed_aliases, absorbed_visitors, total_visitors}
    for the operator confirmation message.

    Rules:
    - Aliases referenced in config but absent from discovery are silently
      ignored (config can lag the data).
    - If a canonical key is absent from discovery but at least one alias is
      present, the canonical record is synthesized from the highest-visitor
      alias (so the merged row is still attributed to the canonical name).
    - If the SAME alias is listed under TWO different canonical keys, the
      function raises ValueError — that is a config-side mistake that should
      surface loudly, not be silently resolved.

    Idempotent: applying the merge to already-merged input is a no-op
    (aliases removed in the first pass aren't present in the input the
    second time).
