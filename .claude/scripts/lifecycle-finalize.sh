# Usage: bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-finalize.sh <skill>
# Output: FINALIZE_COMPLETE + EPILOGUE_STRATEGY=A|B
#
# Steps (unconditional — runs for all skills):
#   1. Verify all states completed (warn if missing)
#   2. Rerun ALL state VERIFY commands from state-registry.json (warn on failure)
#   3. Q-score: read .runs/q-dimensions.json → call write-q-score.py (skip if absent)
#   4. Epilogue strategy: output EPILOGUE_STRATEGY=A (diffs vs main) or B (no diffs)
#
# Steps (unconditional — runs for all skills):
#   5. Delivery: read .runs/ artifacts → gate checks → commit/push/PR/auto-merge
#   6. Write .runs/verify-recheck.json for remediation phase (mandatory execution, graceful degradation)

# --- Step 4.6: RMG v2 typed-guard artifact existence + advisory recurrence detector ---
# Runs only when .runs/solve-trace.json exists AND prevention_analysis.problem_type
# == "defect". Two responsibilities:
#
#   1. Verify the typed recurrence_guard parses via
#      .claude/scripts/lib/recurrence_guard_parser.py (Phase A). When the guard's
#      kind is in {test, lint, hook, invariant}, assert its `artifact` path is
#      either present in the PR diff (git diff <merge_base>...HEAD --name-only)
#      or already on disk in the repo. When kind=none, assert
#      `unguardability_rationale` is present and non-trivial. Failure BLOCKS
#      delivery. This is the layer that turned recurrence_guard from a
#      documented intent into an enforced artifact.
#
#   1b. Issue #1356: when SKILL_TYPE=analysis-only, pass --analysis-only to the
#       verifier. The flag skips path 1 (artifact-in-diff) because analysis-only
#       skills (e.g. /solve --defect) emit forward-looking guards — the
#       artifact is materialized by the NEXT /resolve cycle, not this one.
#       The kind=none rationale check (path 2) STILL runs unconditionally so
#       analysis-only skills cannot ship `kind=none` without a real rationale.
#
#   2. Best-effort: invoke the recurrence-detector (Phase B) in advisory mode.
#      Wrapped in `set +e` — any non-zero exit logs a warning and is ignored
#      so a flaky detector cannot block delivery (per plan: detector is
#      additive, not load-bearing).
#
# This step exists at lifecycle-finalize time (post-build, pre-PR) rather than
# in adversarial-merge-gate.sh because the hook fires PreToolUse Write/Edit
# when the PR does not yet exist (`gh pr diff` is unavailable). Plan note R2-A7.
