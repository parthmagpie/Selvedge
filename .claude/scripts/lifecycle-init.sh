# lifecycle-init.sh — Phase 1: Initialize skill execution from skill.yaml manifest.
# Usage: bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-init.sh <skill> [--embed] [extra_json]
# Examples:
#   bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-init.sh solve
#   bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-init.sh change '{"preliminary_type":null}'
#   bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-init.sh iterate '{"mode":"check"}'
#   bash .claude/scripts/lifecycle-init.sh verify --embed
#
# Steps:
#   1. Parse .claude/skills/<skill>/skill.yaml → .runs/<skill>-lifecycle.json
#   2. If modes present + extra has mode field → select that mode's states
#   3. If branch field present + not in worktree → create branch
#   4. Create canonical context via init-context.sh <skill>
#
# Fallback: if skill.yaml not found → warn, call init-context.sh only (v1 compat)

# --- Step 5b: Embed → auto-skip the shared epilogue state (state 99) ---
# When a skill is embedded inside another (e.g. /verify inside /bootstrap at
# state 19b), only the parent runs the observation/delivery epilogue. Adding
# "99" to the embedded context's skip_states ensures lifecycle-next.sh returns
# FINALIZE for the embed (triggering EMBED_COMPLETE upstream) instead of
# dispatching to state-99-epilogue.md. Also sets embed_skip_epilogue=true as
# a belt-and-suspenders flag that survives state-level wholesale rewrites of
# skip_states (e.g. resolve/state-3b).

# --- Step 5c: snapshot prose-gates fail_mode for in-flight safety ---

# Legacy contexts (no snapshot field, or older snapshot version) fall through
# to prior_default → no in-flight regression. Closes #1449/#1431/#1433 in-flight
